| Frequency      | This use case will be performed in order to route each file uploaded to the  system. It is expected that each Submitting Entity (10 NCAs not  delegating data collection in their jurisdiction and up to 160 TV/SI) will  upload one or several files daily.  It will be used too for feedback file use case and data distribution use  cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Business rules | NCAs not delegating data collection will provide the full instrument  reference data by 23:59 CET to ESMA.  However, in case no validations are performed by the NCA, the NCA shall  forward the files received as soon as they are received, and no later than  21:30 CET.  However, files received by NCAs from their TV / SI after the 21:00 CET  cut - off time are expected along with the next day data submissions. E.g.  if a file is received at 21:15 it should not be forwarded to ESMA at 21:20,  but it may be forwarded at 21:40 (if 21:30 is the applicable NCA cut-off  time) or at 0:15 am next day (if 23:59 CET is the applicable NCA cut-off  time). |

- 1.3 for CANINS as per Table 10 Instrument reference data message table
2. The ESMA System checks that the submitted file references the same XML Schema, in the same version and validates the submitted file as follows
- BizData is validated against head.003.001.01.xsd,
- BizData/Hdr/AppHdr is validated against head.001.001.01\_ESMA\_UG\_1.0.0.xsd,
- BizData/Pyld/Document is validated against the XML Schema corresponding to the incoming file's "HUB File Type" as per tables 10 and 11.
3. The ESMA System inserts in the Reporting Files Table as described in Table 13 -Reporting Files table:
- The timestamp component in the name of the submitted file;
- The name of the submitted file excluding the timestamp component.
4. Validation is successful, and no error is reported .
5. The ESMA System proceeds with processing and validating the content of the file .
- 1a./2a The ESMA System has confirmed that the file structure does not correspond to the schema .

3a. The ESMA System inserts in the Reporting Files Table as described in Table 13 -Reporting Files table:

- The timestamp component
- The Name of the submitted file excluding the timestamp component

6a. The ESMA System proceeds to generating file feedback for the file with the status " Rejected" d" with FIL -104 or FIL -105 as described in Table 32 -Format Validation Rules .

- 4.a/4a . a The ESMA System raises a violation of PK constraint: a file with the exact same name has been previously submitted to ESMA.
- 6a. The ESMA System proceeds to generating file feedback for the file with the status "Rejected" with FIL-107 Error as described in Table 32 -Format Validation Rules .

Once for each file submitted by a submitting entity. Each entity is expected to submit at least one file but can also make multiple submissions due to failed validation, corrections or file size considerations.

## 3.3.2.1 On the fly processing phase

The ESMA System processes the submitted file on the fly. However, files submitted after the applicable cut -off time on day T will only start being processed when the consistent reference data table prepared for day T+1 publication is ready .

The ESMA System registers in a dedicated table all records from the submitted file which successfully passed data transmission, data format, and data content validations. This table is called Received Reference data table2in this document and is constantly updated . As submitting entities are expected to repeatedly report the same information every day for instruments that do not change, the system will receive the same (ISIN, MIC, RTS23 fields) record every day. Multiple submission of the exact same (ISIN, MIC, RTS23 fields) by the same Submitting Entity are considered the same record and will be stored under the same RECORD\_ID. The ESMA System will keep track of the list of all reception date times of each record, at the level of ESMA and at the level of the NCA . The system allows reporting entities to cancel an ISIN -MIC combination, in case they have previously reported such a record by mistake (the cancelled records are marked respectively in the Received Reference data table) . Reporting entities are also allowed to report again the (ISIN, MIC) record, and in that case the system treats it as normal (non-cancelled) ISIN-MIC record again.

For all the non -cancelled instruments, the ESMA System determines the RCA of the instrument and determines the record which holds the RTS23 fields to be used consistently across all TV/SI for the instrument [RCA record]. For that purpose, a set of attributes are calculated. In addition to the determination of RCA, the system enables to reassess the RCA (of any instrument still not terminated) under a request process manually initiated by a NCA user or and an ESMA Business Administrator, or automatically on a yearly basis (for "equity / equity Like" instruments only). For that purpose, we will use the "RCA data table" with ISIN as PK.

In order to cover the "RCA manual change processes" for an ISIN as defined in BRD 70, we will use another table ("RCA manual change process data table") to store temporarily the necessary attributes identifying the request initiated by the requester entity (NCAs, ESMA) in a pending status until that request is approved by the approver entity (NCAs). Once approved, the change of RCA is applied:

- Upcoming RCA in the RCA reference data table is replaced by the requested RCA.
- RCA record is recalculated for that ISIN and is updated accordingly in the RCA data table.
- Upcoming RCA of derivatives having that ISIN as single underlying in the RCA reference data table is replaced by the requested RCA provided that the corresponding RCA has approved the change.
- RCA record of derivatives having that ISIN as single underlying is recalculated for that ISIN and is updated accordingly in the RCA data table.

TABLE 4 -FIELDS OF RCA MANUAL CHANGE PROCESS DATA TABLE

For Equity (Equity-like) instruments, in order to cover the "yearly RCA reassessment" as defined in BRD 69. (Automatic yearly reassessment), we will use another table ("RCA Yearly reassessment process data table") to store temporarily the result of the yearly turnover calculation which is triggered as soon as possible when all necessary data are collected by the FIRDS transparency System. Unless otherwise agreed by the concerned NCAs, the result of the reassessment process will become applicable when preparing the data for the 1 st of April publication.

| Reassessed  RCA The RCA resulting from the yearly reassessment for the “ISIN” and for the  “Year”. Unless otherwise agreed by the concerned NCAs, the “Reassessed  RCA” becomes the “Upcoming RCA” for this ISIN on the 1 year of the reassessment. |              |

Once RCA determination has taken place, the system will add to the "NEW AND ON TIME RECORDS TABLE" all the records' RECORD\_ID which are flagged as Latest received AND

- are related to an instrument which upcoming RCA has been updated during the current reporting day (Modification flag in the RCA data table is true) .

Next, the ESMA System will extract from the " Received reference data table " , for each submitted instrument, the records which are flagged as the RCA record of those instruments and stores them in daily working table called " Reference Fields table " .

Finally, as per section 3.3.10 , the ESMA system updates, recursively based on the already existing records, a new table called " Consistent Reference Data Table " 4 as follows: for each record RECORD\_ID in the New and On time data table , the ESMA System computes a new record by joining with the ISIN the content of the Reference Fields table. The validity period of the created record, defined by ValidFromDate and ValidToDate of each (ISIN, MIC) record is recalculated by comparing the new record with the already one existing in the "Consistent Reference Data Table" .

Once the Consistent Reference Data Table is successfully updated, the ESMA System generates the full/delta/invalid/cancellation records files for both NCA and Public users. The ESMA System then triggers the distribution of the NCA's file to NCAs. Once the distribution is successfully terminated, the publication is triggered . Public files are uploaded onto the download interface in the ESMA publication interface. In addition, the ESMA System will offer a web interface to search and display reference data as per contained in the Consistent Reference Data Table. In order to ensure security of the data contained in the Consistent Reference data table, the public user will access a copy of that table, the publication table, which is updated on daily basis during the publication process.

In addition, the system shall have mechanisms in place to avoid that interfacing systems needing access reference data during the 00:00 – 08:00 period retrieve inconsistent data due to ongoing updates taking place during the post-processing phase. Proposals on the best approach will be expected from the provider in charge of the technical specifications and development of the system 5 .

- 3.1 checks whether it exists in the Received Reference Data Table an (ISIN, MIC) record which latest Received flag is TRUE, called Previous\_Record
- 3.2 computes a new unused RECORD\_ID for the submitted record (e.g. RECORD\_ID starts at 1 . and is incremented each time the system creates a new record).
- 3.3 Inserts in the "Received reference data table" the following attributes:
- New RECORD\_ID calculated in step 3 . 1
- HCRR calculated in step 1.
- Submitted RTS23 fields
- Submitting Entity Code is set to the Sender in the filename of the submitted file
- Received Status to "REFR"

[which shall be the HUBSenderCode associated to the MIC of the submitted record as per Reporting Flow view (Table 19 - Reporting Flow view) according to the passed content validation.]

- Country of jurisdiction of the "TV/SI (RTS23 field 6)" with the NCA country associated to the MIC of the submitted record in the Trading Venue Mapping view (based on records with ValidityEndDate is NULL).
- Latest Received flag to FALSE
- Consistent flag to FALSE
- FileSequenceId to &lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt; in the name of the submitted file .
- 3.4 Initiates the list of ESMA Reception Date Time for that New RECORD\_ID with the ESMA Reception Date Time of the submitted record.
- 3.5 Initiates the list of NCA Reception Date Time for that New RECORD\_ID with the NCA Reception Date Time of the submitted record if provided.
4. In case a record is found in step 2 , the ESMA System:
- adds the ESMA Reception Date Time of the submitted record to the list of ESMA reception date time related to the found record .
- adds, if provided, the NCA reception date time to the list of NCA reception date time related to the record found.
- updates the FileSequenceId with &lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt; in the name of the submitted file.
- updates the Submitting Entity with the Sender in the name of the submitted file.
- Updates the country of jurisdiction of the "TV/SI (RTS23 field 6)" with the NCA country code associated to the MIC of the submitted record in the Trading Venue Mapping view (based on records with ValidityEndDate as NULL)

1. The ESMA system identifies the record with the same ISIN, MIC and Latest Received flag as TRUE (Previous\_Record)
2. Computes a new unused RECORD\_ID for the cancelled record (e.g. RECORD\_ID starts at 1. and is incremented each time)

- Latest Received flag to FALSE
- Consistent flag to FALSE
- FileSequenceId to &lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt; in the name of the submitted file.
4. Inserts in the "Received reference data table" the following attributes, from the Previous\_Record
- RTS23 Field 2 -Instrument full name.
- RTS23 Field 3 -Instrument classification: A complete and accurate CFI code.
- RTS23 Field 4 -Commodities derivative indicator: Indication as to whether the financial instrument falls within the definition of commodities derivative under Article 2(1)(30) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.
- RTS23 Field 13 -Notional currency 1: Currency in which the notional is denominated.
- RTS23 Field 5 -Issuer or operator of the trading venue identifier: LEI of issuer or trading venue operator.
- RTS23 Field 8 -Request for admission to trading by issuer: Whether the issuer of the financial instrument has requested or approved the trading or admission to trading of their financial instruments on a trading venue.

6. Updates in the "Received reference data table" the HCRR as calculated in previous step
7. Initiates the list of ESMA Reception Date Time for that New RECORD\_ID with the ESMA Reception Date Time of the submitted record.
8. The system updates the latest received flag of the (submitted ISIN, submitted MIC) records as follows:
- If ESMA Reception Date Time of the submitted record is later than or equal to the latest ESMA Reception Date Time across all records having the same (ISIN, MIC), set "Last received flag" to FALSE for all these records, and set "Last received flag" to TRUE for the submitted record.

Alternate flow 2: Instrument did not yet start being traded and RCA has not been overridden as per section 3.3.6.8 Determine the RCA record of the submitted instrument .

Otherwise, the upcoming RCA of the submitted record needs to be calculated , in which case the System determines the appropriate method for that calculation as follows:

1. The system extracts from the submitted record the instrument classification (CFI\_CODE). The system extracts from the Received Reference Data Table the CFI Code of all records with
- a. same ISIN
- b. Latest Received flag = TRUE
- c. Termination date time is NULL or is greater than or equal to T-1.
- d. "Withdrawn flag" of the submitted record's "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table.
- e. Received Status is "REFR"

In case no records retrieved the system extracts from the Received Reference Data Table the CFI Code of all records with

{covers the case regarding new records with termination date in the past}

- a. same ISIN
- b. Latest Received flag = TRUE
- c. "Withdrawn flag" of the submitted record's "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table.
- d. Received Status is "REFR"
2. For each distinct CFI Code returned, the system finds the matching "CFI construct" pattern in the CFI / RCA rule mapping table as follows:
- where an alphabetic character is used at a given position in the " CFI construct" pattern, it must match exactly the CFI code character at the same position;
- where a wildcard (*) character is used at a given position in the "CFI construct" pattern, any character at the same position in the CFI code matches.

The CFI code's "Applicable RCA determination rule", is the "RTS22 rule " corresponding to the matching "CFI construct" pattern.

3. If all distinct CFI codes are mapped to the same "Applicable RCA determination rule", the system proceeds to the next steps. Otherwise, the system sets the "Applicable RCA determination rule" to 5.

In case the “RTS22 rule” field is “RTS22 Art.16 (1) and (2) (“equity/ equity like”)”, the system determines the RCA as per section 3.3.6.4 sets Applicable RCA determination rule of the submitted instrument  to 2 . 5.  In case the “RTS22 rule” field is “RTS22 Art.16 (3) and (4) ("debt")”,  the system determines the RCA as per section 3.3.6.5 ,  sets  Applicable RCA determination rule of the submitted instrument to 3 6.  In case the RTS22 rule” field is “RTS 22 Art.16 (5).a ("equity  derivatives")” or “RTS 22 Art.16 (5).b ("debt derivatives")”, the  system determines the RCA as per section 0, sets Applicable RCA  determination rule of the submitted instrument to 4 . 7.

## Normal Flow

The upcoming RCA of the submitted instrument is updated in the "RCA data table".

- The system extracts from the ''Received instrument reference table'' the "Date of admission to trading or date of first trade" of the records which satisfy all the following conditions:
- o Latest received flag is TRUE
- o ISIN is the ISIN of the submitted instrument.
- o Termination date time is NULL or is greater than or equal to T-1.
- o Withdrawn flag of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table"
- o Received Status is "REFR"

In case no records retrieved the system extracts from the ''Received instrument reference table'' the "Date of admission to trading or date of first trade" of the records which satisfy all the following conditions

{covers the case regarding new records with termination date in the past}

- o same ISIN
- o Latest Received flag = TRUE
- o "Withdrawn flag" of the submitted record's "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table.
- o Received Status is "REFR"
- In case all are NULL, the ESMA System determines the RCA as per section 3.3.6.7, and sets Applicable RCA determination rule of the submitted record to 5.

## Otherwise (at least one TV/SI has reported the field 11 and "Earliest RTS23 field 11" is not NULL)

- The system extracts from the ''Received instrument reference table'' the record the records which satisfy all the following conditions:
- o Latest received flag is TRUE
- o ISIN is the ISIN of the submitted instrument
- o Termination date time is NULL or is greater than or equal to T-1.
- o Withdrawn flag of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table"

Determine Applicable RCA calculation rule – triggers

The upcoming RCA of the submitted instrument is updated in the "RCA data table". .

1. The ESMA system extracts from the " Received reference data table " the records which satisfy all the following conditions:
2. o latest received flag is TRUE
3. o ISIN is the ISIN of the submitted instrument
4. o Termination is NULL or is greater than or equal to T-1
5. o Withdrawn flag of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table"
6. o Received Status is "REFR"

[Captures all the TV/SI where the submitted instrument is currently traded]

- If this returns no record, the system extracts from the "Received reference data table" the records which satisfy all the following conditions:
- o latest received flag is TRUE
- o ISIN is the ISIN of the submitted instrument
- o Withdrawn flag of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table"
- o Received Status is "REFR"

[In case of instruments reported late after they were terminated, the above will retrieve the latest reference data received for that instrument]

2. The ESMA System extracts the Underlying instrument codes (26a) for each record found in step 1.
3. In case Field 26a is not the same for all records or is NULL for some records (TV(s) report inconsistent underlying information) , or is equal to Field 1 for some records, the ESMA System determines the RCA as per section 3.3.6.7 , and sets Applicable RCA determination rule of the submitted record to 5.
4. Otherwise [The ESMA System has checked that the submitting instrument has a single underlying and that underlying instrument is the same across all TV/SI on which the submitted instrument is currently traded], the ESMA System:

The ESMA system extracts from the "Received reference data table" the records which ISIN is the field 26a of the submitted instrument , their " Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" has withdrawn flag as FALSE in the "NCA reference data table" and the Received Status is "REFR" .

- 4.1 In case no record is found (the underlying does not exist in the Reference database or the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" of the underlying has withdrawn flag as TRUE in the "NCA reference data table or the retrieved records are cancelled), the System determines the RCA and the RCA record of the submitted instrument as follows:
- 4.1.1 Determines the RCA as per paragraph 3.3.6.3, and sets Applicable RCA determination rule of the submitted record to 1.

## o Received Status is "REFR"

If this returns no record, the system extracts from the "Received reference data table" the records which satisfy all the following conditions:

- o latest received flag is TRUE
- o ISIN is the ISIN of the submitted instrument
- o Withdrawn flag of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table"
- o Received Status is "REFR"
2. For each record identified in step 1, the ESMA system determines the record reported first for the ISIN – using the earliest among the ESMA reception time and, if not null, the NCA reception time -, across all records including any historical ones , and the ESMA System:
- Sets the upcoming RCA of that instrument in the " RCA data table" to the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" of the record as stored in the Received Reference Data Table) .
- Sets the Modification flag of the submitted instrument in the "RCA data table" to TRUE.
- Triggers the determination of the "RCA record" for the submitted instrument ("Determine the RCA record of the submitted instrument" use case – see 3.3.6.8).

## Postconditions

## Normal Flow

- Determine RCA based on LEI – triggers
- Determine RCA based on "Date of request for admission" or "Date of admission to trading or date of first trade" – triggers
- Determine RCA based on underlying –triggers
- Determine RCA based on Reception date time – triggers
- (derivatives which underlying's RCA has changed)
- 3.4.4 (manual RCA change)
- 3.3.9 (yearly RCA reassessment)
- 3.3.6.2 normal flow step 1.b (new record received for the ISIN)

This use case should also be triggered , at each post-processing phase , for the following cases

## 1. Termination on MIC of the RCA record

For all ISINs for which the Termination Date on the "MIC of the RCA record" is not NULL and is strictly less than T-1 (where T is the next publication date).

For optimization purposes, the system may apply this rule to ISINs for which the termination date on the RCA -MIC is between PvsT -1 included and T -2 included where T is the next publication date and PvsT is the day of the last successful publication.

## 2. Cancellation on MIC of the RCA record

For all ISINs for which the submitted MIC, from a cancelled record, is the "MIC of the RCA record"

The “RCA record” record for the submitted instrument is up to date.

## 1. Retrieval of records

The system returns from the "Received reference data table" the records, related to instrument(s), which satisfy all the following conditions and according to specified market's priority check order as follows

(New conditions – Market's priority, RCA jurisdiction and Received Status of MIC's)

## 1.1. Within RCA jurisdiction

- " Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is equal to the " Upcoming RCA " related to the ISIN in the "RCA data table"
- Withdrawn flag of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table
- Received Status is "REFR"

## Market’s priority check order

The system checks if there are records matching the conditions below for trading venues for which their "MarketType" is as follows:

If record(s) retrieved, the system continues to 2. Determination of RCA\_RECORD, else the system continues to 1.5 No records retrieved

## 1.5. No records retrieved

In case no record(s) retrieved from previous steps, then the whole process, steps 1.1 to 1.4, is performed again, keeping the same Market's priority check order, but without checking the following conditions

## Conditions NOT to be checked for step 1.5

- Respective MIC(s) is active, identified by (ValidityEndDate is null or is greater than or equal to T-1)
- Termination date time is NULL or is greater than or equal to T-1.

## 2. Determination of RCA\_RECORD

The system will determine the "RCA\_RECORD" as the record with the earliest "Date of admission to trading or date of first trade" "RTS23 field 11", among those returned in step 1. Retrieval of records

- 2.1. In case one single record is returned, that record becomes the " RCA\_RECORD " for the submitted instrument. The "RCA\_RECORD" field in the RCA data table for that ISIN is set to the RECORD\_ID of that record .
- 2.2. In case there more than one records with the same earliest RTS23 field 11 , then the record first reported, using the earliest ESMA reception time or, if null, the earliest NCA reception time, becomes the "RCA\_RECORD" for the submitted instrument. The "RCA\_RECORD" field in the RCA data table for that ISIN is set to the RECORD\_ID of that record.

The system prepares a new list (RECORD_ID, MIC, yearly turnover,  Market type) [List3] by joining [List1] and [List2] and identifies the MIC  with the highest turnover based on market priority (RMKT then MLTF) 4.1 The system identifies the MIC with the highest yearly  positive ( > 0 Euros) turnover for the previous year,  traded on Regulated markets, identified by  (“MarketType” equals RMKT). If a single MIC is  identified flow continues to 5, else flow continues to  next check. 4.2 The system identifies the MIC with the highest yearly  positive ( > 0 Euros) turnover traded on Multilateral  Trading Facilities, identified by (“MarketType” equals  MLTF). If a single MIC is identified flow continues to 5,  else this ISIN is disregarded from the process.  5.  In case one single record is returned, that record becomes the  “RCA_RECORD” for the submitted instrument. The  “RCA_RECORD” field in the RCA data table for that ISIN is set to  the RECORD_ID of that record. 6.

- o Termination is NULL or is greater than or equal to T-1
- o Withdrawn flag of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table"
- o Received Status is "REFR"

[Captures all the TV/SI where the submitted instrument is currently traded]

If this returns no record, the system extracts from the "Received reference data table" the records which satisfy all the following conditions:

- o latest received flag is TRUE
- o ISIN is the ISIN of the submitted instrument
- o Withdrawn flag of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table"
- o Received Status is "REFR"

[In case of instruments reported late after they were terminated, the above will retrieve the latest reference data received for that instrument]

3. In case Field 26a is not the same for all records or is NULL for some records (TV(s) report inconsistent underlying information) or is equal to Field 1 for some records, the ESMA System determines the RCA as per paragraph 3.3.6.7, and sets Applicable RCA determination rule of the submitted record to 5 .

Otherwise [the submitted instrument has a single underlying and that underlying instrument is the same across all TV/SI on which the submitted instrument is currently traded] , the ESMA System checks that this underlying instrument exists in the "Received reference data table" and retains the underlying's record with earliest field 11 as follows:
4. 4.1 The ESMA system extracts from the "Received reference data table" the records which
- ISIN is the field 26a of the submitted instrument ,
- Latest Received flag is TRUE
- " Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" has withdrawn flag as FALSE in the "NCA reference data table".
- Received Status is "REFR"
9. 4.2 In case no record is found (the underlying does not exist in the database , or their "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" has withdrawn flag as TRUE in the "NCA reference data table" or the record is cancelled), the ESMA System determines the RCA as per paragraph 3.3.6.3 , and sets Applicable RCA determination rule of the submitted record to 1.

| Normal Flow    | 1.  The system extracts from “RCA_MIC_ADJUSTMENTS data table”, the  ISIN and adjusted RCA-MIC such that •  Active_change is TRUE •  ValidityStartDate is not null and prior to T (T included) •  ValidityToDate is null or later to T (T included) 2.  For each ISIN extracted from step 1, the system retrieves the  RECORD_ID, from “Received reference data table” which comply with  the following conditions •  ISIN is the ISIN retrieved from step 1. •  MIC is the RCA - MIC retrieved from step 1 •  Latest Flag is TRUE •  Received Status is “REFR”  2.1. In case no records retrieved then the requested change of  RCA_MIC should be ignored . 2.2. For all records successfully retrieved from step 2, the system  should perform the following actions: •  The “RCA_RECORD” field in the  “ RCA data table” for that  ISIN is set to the RECORD_ID of that record. •  The Modification flag field in the “RCA data table” for that ISIN  is set to TRUE. The system should log any errors produced from step 2, into the “RCA_MIC  adjustments error data table ” , as per 6.14 |

In case  •  MIC of the submitted record is different from the RCA_MIC and •  Received Status is “REFR”  3.  The ESMA System extracts the list of RTS fields that need to be excluded from the consistency validation check for a particular set of ISINs. The  system retrieves from the “Validation Exclusions Data Table” the records  for which: •  ISIN pattern matches with the submitted ISIN.  •  Validity End Date is greater than or equal to the Current Date time 4.  The ESMA System extracts from the Received Reference Data Table , •  the “Non - free text field used for consistency checks” and “Free text fields  user for consistency checks” fields, except the ones retrieved in step 3, in RTS23 Field table as per section 6.9; and •  “Non - free text field used for consistency checks” and “Free text fields  user for consistency checks” fields ,  except the ones retrieved in step 3, in RTS 23 Field table as per section 6.9  of the record which |

| Normal Flow   | 1.  The ESMA System extracts from the “Yearly RCA reassessment input  data table” the records for which Year is the current year .  2.  The ESMA System builds a new aggregated (ISIN, reassessed RCA)  list as follows: for each ISIN’s record found in step1: •  Adds to that list a new item (ISIN of the record ,  reassessed RCA of the record) . •  For each ISIN in the  “ Derivative ISIN List ”  of the record, adds to  that list (ISIN in the Derivative ISIN List ,  Reassessed RCA of the  record) . In the following step ,  the ESMA System excludes from the list built in  step 2 the ISINs for which the application of the reassessed RCA has  been bypassed for the current year . 3.  For each ISIN in the list built in step 2, the ESMA System checks  whether it exists in the “RCA manual change process table” an ISIN’s record which date of application is the 1 st  of April of the current year 10 . 3.1 In case a record is found, the ISIN is removed from the List built in  step 2 . 4.  For each ISIN in the list built in step 2, the ESMA System checks whether  it exists in the “RCA manual change process table” an ISIN’s record in  which Request status is  “P “Pending ” . 4.1 In case a record is found, the system updates the record as follows: •  Request status is set to “Rejected”. •  The comment for reason is set as follows: “Cancelled by  application of RCA Yearly Reassessment results on [sysdate] ” . 5.  For each ISIN remaining in the list in step 3 .,  The ESMA System updates  the ISIN’s record in the  “ RCA data table ”  according to the yearly  reassessment results: •  Upcoming RCA is set to the applicable RCA . •  Modification flag is set to TRUE; •  Overridden flag is set to TRUE. For each ISIN remaining in the list in step 3, the ESMA System determines  its RCA record as per use case 3.3.6.8 . |

8

Threshold termination date of received instruments for Yearly Reassessment, can be changed through yearly.reassessment.termination.date.threshold system configuration parameter

9 Application date of RCA reassessment results, can be changed through rca.yealy.reassessment.application.date system configuration parameter.

10 The application of the yearly reassessment concerning ISINs which are stored in that table with a date of application as 1 st of April has been bypassed by both the Current RCA and the Upcoming reassessed RCA.

| Business  Rules | The change is the RCAs concerning Yearly reassessment will be published  in the Instrument Reference data in April 1 st  each year and starts being  applicable from that date. Nevertheless, the application of the Yearly  reassessment may be bypassed through a manual change process and upon  Concerned NCA agreements . |

For each ISIN extracted in the step 3 with Received Status as "REFR" , the ESMA System extracts from the Received Reference Data Table the record which RECORD\_ID is the RCA record in the RCA data table for that ISIN; the following attributes are stored in the "Reference Fields table" in place of the existing ones:
- ISIN
- Upcoming RCA in the RCA data table for the ISIN's record
- Free -text fields used for consistency checks in "RTS 23 fields Table" (section 6.9 RTS23 Fields table)
- Non -Free -Text fields used for consistency checks in "RTS 23 fields Table" (section 6.9 RTS23 Fields table).
5. For each RECORD\_ID in step 2, the ESMA System prepares a new (ISIN, MIC) record which will be stored in the Consistent Reference Data Table in steps 6 and 7 as follows:
6. For the records with Received Status as "REFR", insert records in Consistent Reference Data Table
16. 6.1. For the following attributes, the values in the "New and On time records table" are retained: ISIN, Latest ESMA Reception date time, and Trading venue dependent fields in "RTS 23 fields Table" (section 6.9 RTS23 Fields table).
17. 6.2. For the following attributes, the values of ISIN's record in the " Reference Fields table" are retained: Upcoming RCA.

- 6.3. For each of the attributes "Free -Text used for consistency check" [List1] AND "Non-free-Text used for consistency check" [List2] as stated in Table 21 -RTS23 Fields table:
- 6.3.1.The ESMA System compares the value in the "New and on time records table" with the value of the ISIN's record in the " Reference Fields table".
- 6.3.2.In case those values are equal, the ESMA System retains that value for the new record.
- 6.3.3.In case those values are different, the ESMA System retains for the new record:
- the value in the "Reference Fields table" for attributes in List2,
- the value in the "New and On time records table" for attributes in List1,
- FALSE for the consistent flag.
- 6.3.4.In case those values are different, the system adds the ISIN and number ID of the attribute in the Inconsistent ISIN List and associated fields in the "TV/SI reporting table" as described in Table 41 -TV/SI Reporting table for (MIC, current system date) for that ISIN.
7. For the records with Received Status as "CANC", insert records in Consistent Reference Data Table
- 7.1. For the following attributes, the values in the "New and On time records table" are retained:
- ISIN
- Latest ESMA Reception date time
- Trading-Venue dependent fields as described in Table 20 RTS23 Fields table.
- Free -text fields used for consistency checks in "RTS 23 fields Table" (section 6.8 RTS23 Fields table).
- Non -Free -text fields used for consistency checks in "RTS 23 fields Table" (section 6.8 RTS23 Fields table).
- 7.2. Set consistent flag to FALSE
8. For each record resulting of step 4, the ESMA System computes its HCCR as the hash value of the whole set of { all RTS23 fields + Upcoming RCA + RCA\_MIC }, using a hash function with sufficient collision resistance to ensure that two different versions of the { RTS23 fields + Upcoming RCA + RCA\_MIC} will not lead to the same hash value for the same ISIN, MIC combination 11 .
9. For each record resulting of step 3, The ESMA System updates the "Consistent Reference Data Table" as follows:
- 9.1. Checks whether it exists a record in the "Consistent Reference Data Table" with the same ISIN, MIC and HCCR.
- 9.2. If such record is found:

11 The choice of the hash function will be discussed during the system technical specifications

- Latest ESMA reception date time for this (ISIN, MIC) is set to the Latest ESMA reception date time of the record; and
- 9.2.1.If Received Status = "REFR" then Consistent Status is set to "Unchanged" unless it is terminated.
- 9.3. If no such record is found, checks whether it exists a record in the "Consistent Reference Data Table" with the same (ISIN, MIC).
- 9.3.1.In case no such record is found [the instrument has never been reported to ESMA], inserts the new (ISIN, MIC) in the "Consistent Reference Data Table" as follows:
- 9.3.2.If Received Status is “REFR”
- 9.3.2.1.“Latest record flag” is set to TRUE
- 9.3.2.2.In case the termination date is not NULL, and date of the termination date is strictly prior to T-1, then set

PublishedFromDate AND PublishedToDate to NULL,

Consistent Status to “Terminated”,

ValidFromDate to T and ValidToDate to NULL

{Captures the case of a terminated instrument reported late}

- 9.4.1."Latest record flag" of the PREVIOUS RECORD is set to FALSE.
- 9.4.2.The system updates the field, of the PREVIOUS RECORD, ValidToDate to T -1
- 9.4.3.If the Received Status is “REFR”
- 9.4.3.1. If the PublishedToDate of PREVIOUS RECORD is NULL [the invalid records are excluded]:
- 9.4.3.2. The system updates the respective fields of the PREVIOUS RECORD as follows

PublishedToDate set to PvsT

9.4.3.2.1. If Termination Date is NULL or is greater than or equal to (T-1) the system inserts the new record with

| Normal Flow    | An ESMA Business Administrator chooses “Action on  instruments/Termination” on the ESMA Extranet. 1.  Selection of input file  1.1. User selects the input file, by using a selection dialog box. The  following checks should be performed by the system, after the  selection of the file.  The Input file should be in the form of a csv, with comma separated fields,  with header information and rows as follows : •  ISIN •  MIC •  TERMINATION_DATE The system should be able to successfully process input files which can  have up to 10.000 lines. In case input file has more lines ESMA system  should reject the file and inform the user with a relevant error message. 2.  Validation |

<!-- image -->

The system will validate each row of the input file and retrieve records based on the following:

- 2.1. The system checks that the (ISIN-MIC) exists in "Received Reference Data Table" among records which Latest Received Flag is TRUE and Received Status is "REFR" .
- 2.2. The system should validate the TERMINATION\_DATE from input file, for each ISIN -MIC combination, as follows.
- The TERMINATION\_DATE should a valid date and in a sensible range (no prior than 31-12-1899 12 ) or
- Null

In case no records retrieved, or TERMINATION\_DATE cannot be validated, the system should log this record ,into the " Set TERMINATION\_DATE error data table", as per 6.15 , and continue processing the remaining lines from input file

3. Execution -Preparation
2. The system stores temporarily the validated records in the " TEMP\_TERMINATIONS data table". The system inserts new records for all ISIN, MIC combinations that passed the validations, as follows:
3. 3.1. In case at least one record exist in "TEMP\_TERMINATIONS data table" for the ISIN, MIC combination, the system updates the "Active\_flag" column of the existing record to FALSE .
4. 3.2. The system inserts in the " " TEMP\_TERMINATIONS data table" a new record for that (ISIN, MIC) combination with the following attributes:
- ISIN
- MIC
- USER\_ID as extracted from the logged-in user
- TERMINATION\_DATE
- Active\_Flag default value will be TRUE
- Filename
4. Execution – Application

The system updates the "Received reference data table" and the "Set TERMINATION DATE data table" and applies the requests regarding termination date, set by ESMA Data Manager's, at the first steps of the next post -processing phase , as follows:

- 4.1. For each (ISIN, MIC) combination that exists in " TEMP\_TERMINATIONS data table", the system extracts the record having the "Active Flag" as TRUE.
- 4.2. The system identifies in the "Received reference data table" the record, called Previous\_Record, with the same ISIN, MIC, the Latest Received flag is TRUE and the Received Status is "REFR.

- 4.3. Updates the Latest Received flag of that record to FALSE
- 4.4. The system inserts in the "Received reference data table" a new record for that (ISIN, MIC) combination with the following attributes:
- RTS23 fields as retrieved from the Previous\_Record for the ISIN, MIC
- Submitting Entity Code as retrieved from the Previous\_Record for the ISIN, MIC
- FileSequenceId as "ESMA-TERM "
- Country of jurisdiction of the "TV/SI (RTS23 field 6)" as retrieved from the Previous\_Record for the ISIN, MIC
- Received Status as "REFR"
- Set ESMA Reception Date Time to current date
- Set NCA Reception Time to empty
- Set Technical RECORD\_ID to empty
- Latest Received flag to TRUE
- Consistent flag to TRUE
- TERMINATION\_DATE as retrieved from the record extracted in step 4.1
- HCRR should be generated with the RTS 23 fields.
- 4.5. The system inserts in the "Set TERMINATION DATE data table" all the records that exist in the "TEMP\_TERMINATIONS data table" (merely a copy). Afterwards, the system truncates the Temp table, in order to handle the new requests .

The system applies the requests regarding termination date, set by ESMA Data Manager's, in the next post-processing.

## Normal Flow

NB: T is the day of the next publication date

1. An ESMA Business Administrator chooses " RCA management/RCA\_MIC change management" on the ESMA portal (resp. on the ESMA Intranet).
2. Selection of the input file

User selects the input file, by using a selection dialog box. The following checks should be performed by the system, after the selection of the file.

Input file should be in the form of a csv, with comma separated fields, with the following fields :

- ISIN
- NEW\_RCA\_MIC
- ValidFromDate
- ValidToDate
- Reason\_for\_change , (predefined values13)

The input file can have a maximum of 10.000 lines. In case input file has more lines, system should reject the file and inform the user with a relevant error message.

## 3. Validation

The system will validate the following fields from input file, for each ISIN, NEW\_RCA\_MIC combination, as follows :

- ValidFromDate is a valid date
- ValidToDate is a valid date or ValidToDate is null
- ValidFromDate should be, prior or equal, to ValidToDate, in case ValidToDate is a valid date (not null)
- Reason\_for\_change, should exists in the predefined list of values
- The ISIN, NEW\_RCA\_MIC combination proposed should exists in the FIRDS database (ISIN-MIC combination with Latest Received Flag as TRUE and Received Status as "REFR")

In case a record cannot be validated, the system should log this record ,into the "RCA\_MIC adjustments error data table", as per 6.14, and continue processing the remaining lines from input file

## 4. Execution

The system should populate “RCA\_MIC\_ADJUSTMENTS data table”

- 4.1. The system , inserts new records, which successfully pass validation from step 3, with the following fields
- ISIN
- MIC
- USER\_ID (Username from extranet login)
- ValidFromDate
- ValidToDate

13 The predefined list of values that can be used as the reason for change for the RCA-MIC should be configurable in the system. NB: this list will be different and should be handled independently from the list of reason for changes that can be used for manual RCA change requests.

## Frequency Business rules

Assumptions

- Reason\_for\_change
- Active\_change, default value will be TRUE

## 4.2. History of submitted RCA\_MIC changes

In case there is a new submission for an existing ISIN in "RCA\_MIC\_ADJUSTMENTS data table", the system should update the value of Active\_change of the existing record to FALSE , and insert a new record with the submitted information, as per step 4.

The system applies the requests regarding RCA-MIC, set by ESMA Data Manager's, in the next post-processing phase, as per 3.3.6.13 .

Ad-hoc

## 5. Update “RCA Yearly reassessment process data” table

The system inserts a new record (or update in case it already exists a record for that (ISIN, Year) combination) using the following attributes:

- Year is the current year;
- ISIN;
- Reassessed RCA is the NCA country, in the Trading Venue Mapping for the MIC identified in step 2;
- Derivative ISINs as list of ISINs, for which all the following conditions apply
- o Having ISIN as Single Underlying ISIN (RTS23 Field 26a) in the Consistent RDT
- o Latest Received Flag as TRUE
- o Consistent Status &lt;&gt; "CANC"
- o Termination Date as NULL or strictly after the date configured in the "yearly.reassessment.termination.date.threshold" parameter of the current year .
- o MIC is the RCA\_MIC of the derivative
- o CFI construct matches the RTS22 rule of "RTS22 Art.16 (5).a ("equity derivatives"), according to Annex 6.3 CFI/RCA rule mapping table

Weekly (from the 8 th of January to the 15 th of March) or in an Ad-hoc basis

The yearly reassessment rules are described in RTS22 Art 16(1) As it is possible to receive corrections on reference and transparency data, it is proposed to run this use case more than once during the 8/Jan – 15/Mar period. The proposed frequency is weekly.

ESMA may initiate the process on behalf of the NCA, in exceptional circumstances.

Authorised user has logged on the extranet.

## NCA/ESMA initiates a request to change the RCA.

The system has registered the request as "Pending" and sent the relevant email notification to the current upcoming RCA and Requested RCA of the instrument.

1. NCA user on behalf of an NCA (resp. ESMA Business Administrator) selects "RCA management/RCA change submission" on a restricted access area of the ESMA Portal (resp. on the ESMA Intranet) .
2. The system displays a webpage (including the username/NCA of the user) allowing the user to manually enter the following data for one or more instrument(s):
- ISIN for which the RCA change is requested.
- Requested RCA for that ISIN.
- Selection of a reason among a dropdown list of standard reasons for change. The list of standard reasons for change shall be configurable in the system.
- Optionally, an additional comment (free text) to provide further details on the reason for the RCA change request.
3. The system validates the values entered using the following controls:
8. o None of the fields defined in step 2 can be empty.
9. o Each ISIN is entered only once.
10. o It exists a record in the "consistent reference data table" which satisfy all the following conditions
- ISIN is the submitted ISIN;
- (Termination date is NULL) or (Termination date &gt;= Current\_system\_date)
- Received Status is "REFR"

{The entered instrument shall be still traded on at least one TV/SI at the time of the submission according to the latest publication}

- In case the user is a NCA user, the requested RCA or the Upcoming RCA must be the Requesting entity .
4. The system displays the valid entered records (including the name of the instrument related to the entered ISIN).
5. For each entered ISIN (all checks are passed) , The system searches the Derivative instrument(s) still traded according to the latest publication which have the entered ISIN as single underlying as follows: the system extracts from the "Consistent Reference Data Table" the ISIN of the records which satisfy all of the following conditions:

- 6 . For each entered ISIN , the system displays the ISIN found in the step 5. with the following information:
- ISIN
- Requested RCA (same as the associated underlying instrument),
- Upcoming RCA of ISIN's record in the RCA data table.
- An automatically populated text: "Derivative of [ISIN] + reason for which the RCA change was requested for the underlying ISIN", where [ISIN] is the ISIN of the instrument for which the user initially made the request (and thus the reason this derivative appeared in the list).
- 7 . The system asks for final validation of the whole displayed list. The user at this stage cannot modify ISIN, Requested RCA or exchange reason for the derivative instruments.
- 8 . Once the request is confirmed by the user:
- 8.1 For each displayed line, The ESMA System inserts in the "RCA manual change process data table" a new record:
- A new unique Request ID is generated for each RCA change request;
- Requested RCA is set to the entered Requested RCA;
- Upcoming RCA is set to the Upcoming RCA in the RCA data table related to that ISIN;
- Reason for manual change is set to the entered reason;
- Request status is set to "Pending";
- Requester entity is set to the NCA of the current user in case of NCA user;
- ' EU' in case of ESMA business Administrator.
- Approver entity is set to:
- The upcoming RCA in case the requested RCA is the NCA of the current user.
- Otherwise, the requested RCA
- Record timestamp is set to the current system date
- For all RCA change requests automatically added in steps 5 and 6, the system populates the Related Request with the Request ID

- 5.4 The ESMA System sends automated e-mails to each affected NCA (upcoming RCA and requested RCA and addressed to the generic email address in the NCA reference data table) notifying that RCA change request is approved. The email should contain a combination of ISIN in order to reduce the number of emails.
6. In case the user rejects the request of an ISIN or a combination of ISINs, and for each of them, the ESMA System:
- 6.1 sets the request Status to "Rejected" d" in the "RCA manual change process data table " .
- 6.2 sends automated e -mails to each affected NCA (upcoming RCA and requested RCA and addressed to the generic email address in the NCA reference data table) notifying that RCA change request is rejected. The email should contain a combination of ISIN in order to reduce the number of emails .

| Business rules   | ESMA business user will only act on RCA change requests after liaising  with affected parties . RCA should not be manually changed during the post-processing phase,  which occurs on a day T between 00:00 and 08:00, when the system is  preparing the full-file to be published at 08:00, as it would interfere with the  process. RCA changes approved on a day T (from the time when the post processing phase is complete until end of day T) will be reflected on T+1   |

## 3.5.7 Review and act on Yearly reassessment results

| Goal           | The objective of the use case is to enable a NCA user or an ESMA  Business Administrator to view and act on the result of the  calculation of the yearly RCA reassessment before it becomes  applicable the 1 st  of April of each year .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Normal Flow    | 1. A NCA user (resp. an ESMA Business Administrator) [current user]  chooses “RCA change management” on the ESMA portal (resp. on the  ESMA Intranet). 2. The ESMA System selects in the “Instrument yearly turnover view” the  records in junction with the “RCA Yearly reassessment process data  table ” , the “RCA manual change process table”, the “MIC reference  data table”, the “RCA data table” the following attributes: •  ISIN (identifier): in the  “ Instrument yearly turnover view ” •  ISIN (Name): Financial Instrument Short name in the consistent  reference data table for that ISIN. •  MiFIR identifier: in the  “ Instrument yearly turnover view” •  Current RCA: Upcoming RCA in the  “ RCA data table ”  for the ISIN. •  Year: Year in the  “ Instrument yearly turnover view”. •  MIC (identifier):  MIC in the  “ Instrument yearly turnover view”. •  MIC (Name): InstitutionName in the  “ MIC reference data table ”  for  that MIC. •  Country of jurisdiction: NCA country in the  “ Trading Venue  Mapping table ”  for that MIC  (based on records with  ValidityEndDate is NULL) . |

- Euro Yearly turnover: Euro Yearly turnover in the " Instrument yearly turnover view" w" for that (Year, ISIN, MIC) .
- Upcoming Reassessed RCA: Reassessed RCA in the "RCA Yearly reassessment process data table" for the (Year, ISIN) record.
3. The ESMA System displays the resulting records as per as per user interface described in 3.5.2 , a and allows the user to sort by ISIN, Current RCA, Proposed RCA, year of the reassessment. In case a record has distinct upcoming RCA and reassessed RCA, that record must be highlighted.
4. The ESMA System allows the user to filter records asper user interface described in chapter 3.5.2 .
5. The ESMA System allows the NCA user, only if he/she belongs to the Reassessed RCA or the Upcoming RCA , to bypass the application of the yearly reassessment for the current year .
6. In case the user of the Reassessed RCA (resp. Upcoming RCA) chooses to bypass the application of the yearly reassessment for the current year , the ESMA System checks whether the Upcoming RCA (resp. the Reassessed RCA) has also already chosen to bypass (the bypass action is of " Pending " status) .
- 6.1 IF TRUE, The ESMA System registers the decision of the NCA (the bypass action status is set to "Approved"):
- 6.1.1 updates the "RCA manual change process" as follows: inserts/updates ISIN's record with the following attributes:
- Requested RCA is the Upcoming RCA .
- Date of application is the 1 st of April of the current year.
- 6.1.2 sends automated e -mail to the upcoming RCA notifying that your NCA will continue to be the RCA after the 1st of April .
- 6.2 IF FALSE, the ESMA System registers the decision of the NCA (the bypass action status is set to "Pending") and sends automated e-mail to the Upcoming RCA (resp. Reassessed RCA) notifying the user's NCA decision and requesting to confirm the bypass.
7. In case a user rejects a pending bypass, the ESMA System registers the decision of the NCA (the bypass action status is set to "Rejected") and sends automated e -mail to the user having requested the bypass informing that the NCA disagrees with the bypass decision and the Reassessed RCA will become the RCA of the instrument after the 1st of April .

Assumptions

The first type, for "New", "Modified", "Terminated" records, contains the following fields, in the respective below Xpaths :

Document/FinInstrmRptgRefDataDltaRpt/FinInstrm/NewRcrd

Document/FinInstrmRptgRefDataDltaRpt/FinInstrm/ModfdRcrd

Document/FinInstrmRptgRefDataDltaRpt/FinInstrm/TermntdRcrd

Contents of this first record type are the same as auth.036.001.02\_ESMAUG\_DLTINS\_1.1.0.xsd and added as-is in the updated auth.036.001.03\_ESMAUG\_DLTINS\_1.2.0.xsd

- ISIN
- MIC
- Other RTS23 fields
- ValidFromDate
- ValidToDate (if not NULL)
- NeverPublished flag (if TRUE)
- Upcoming RCA
- RCA record MIC

The second type, for Cancelled records contains the following fields , in the below XPath :

Document/FinInstrmRptgRefDataDltaRpt/FinInstrm/CancRcrd

Contents of the second record type, for Cancellations, are new as per the updated auth.036.001.03\_ESMAUG\_DLTINS\_1.2.0.xsd

- ISIN

3. The name of the NCA File follows the convention as per Annex 2: File naming conventions . The name of the Public file is: DLTINS\_&lt;Next publication date&gt;\_&lt;NumberoftheSplitfile&gt;of&lt;MaxNumberofSplitfiles&gt;.zip.
4. The ESMA System uploads the NCA delta file to the Public folder dedicated to the ESMA System in HUBEX System.

Daily (including ESMA non-working days)

The file must be made available on the HUB for NCAs by 8am on each day

Given the expected high volume of data, the file may be split in several files. The threshold shall be configurable in the system .

It might unlikely happen that the Delta file is empty. In that case a delta file is generated in any case but without FinInstrm block.

Fields using DATE\_TIME\_FORMAT should be expressed in UTC in the following format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ddddddZ (fields 9,10,11,12)

3. The name of the NCA File follows the convention as per Annex 2: File naming conventions. The name of the Public file is: FIRDS\_INVINS\_PUBLIC\_&lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt;\_&lt;YY&gt;.zip
4. The ESMA System uploads the NCA delta file to the Public folder dedicated to the ESMA System in HUBEX System .

Daily (including ESMA non-working days)

The file must be made available on the HUB for NCAs by 8am on each day

Given the expected high volume of data, the file may be split in several files. The threshold shall be configurable in the system .

Fields using DATE\_TIME\_FORMAT should be expressed in UTC in the following format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ddddddZ (fields 9,10,11,12)

That file contains records that are not part of the full file anymore. This includes instruments that are not valid anymore, as well as out-of-date versions of records that have been modified over time.

## 3.7 Instruments Reference Data Publication

## 3.7.1 Overview

The publication interface is accessible through ESMA website and composed of:

1. a U2A search interface ("Instrument search" use case) with a list of predefined filters; and
2. a U2A/A2A interface for aggregated files downloads ("ISIN List Generation and Download" use case).

The export functionality will be accessible only through 2).

| Normal Flow   | NB: T is the day of the next publication date, PvsT is the last day of success  publication  1.  The ESMA System extracts from the Consistent Reference Data  Table the records which: •  ValidFromDate is between [PvsT +1 and T], •  ValidToDate is NULL and  •  latest received flag=1  (captures new records, cancelled records and records already  existing in the previous full file but modified) , OR •  Termination Date is not NULL and Termination date is between  [PvsT -1 and T-2] and •  Status is “Terminated” (captures normally terminated instrument records) 2. The extracted records are used to generate the public delta file based on  the Derived Message Identifier schemas referenced in Table 10  - Instrument reference data message table associated to Business  Application Header (BAH), BAH and business message encapsulation  and Delta file Message components. Two different types of records contained in each public delta file. The first type, for “New”, “Modified”, “Terminated” records, contains  the following fields, in the respective below Xpaths : Document/FinInstrmRptgRefDataDltaRpt/FinInstrm/NewRcrd Document/FinInstrmRptgRefDataDltaRpt/FinInstrm/ModfdRcrd Document/FinInstrmRptgRefDataDltaRpt/FinInstrm/TermntdRcrd Contents of this first record type are the same as  auth.036.001.02_ESMAUG_DLTINS_1.1.0.xsd and added as-is in  the updated auth.036.001.03_ESMAUG_DLTINS_1.2.0.xsd |

## Business Rules

- MIC
- Other RTS23 fields
- ValidFromDate
- ValidToDate (if not NULL)
- NeverPublished flag (if TRUE)
- Upcoming RCA
- RCA record MIC

The second type, for Cancelled records contains the following fields, in the below XPath :

Document/FinInstrmRptgRefDataDltaRpt/FinInstrm/CancRcrd

Contents of the second record type, for Cancellations, are new as per the updated auth.036.001.03\_ESMAUG\_DLTINS\_1.2.0.xsd

- ISIN
- MIC
3. Each file is compressed, and the archive file name is: DLTINS\_&lt;T&gt;\_&lt;NumberoftheSplitfile&gt;of&lt;MaxNumberofSplitfiles&gt;.zip.
4. Once all files have been successfully generated, made available on the Content Delivery Network for download, and link added to the ESMA webpage which lists the files published, the ESMA System sets PvsT to T.

Daily (including ESMA non-working days)

The file must be made available to the public by 9am every day .

Given the expected high volume of data, the file may be split in several files. The threshold shall be configurable in the system.

It might unlikely happen that the Delta file is empty. In that a delta file is generated in any case but without Refdata block.

Fields using DATE\_TIME\_FORMAT should be expressed in UTC in the following format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ddddddZ (fields 9,10,11,12)

| Normal Flow     | 1. The public user populates filters describing the scope of data he/she  wishes to see. 2. The ESMA System queries the “Publication table ”  according to filters and  extracts the records resulting of that query (please refer to Publication table  fields in table above. 3. The system displays the records, and which are presented in table format  on the ESMA website. The system shall limit the number of displayed records up to a number configurable by the ESMA IT Administrator. For each record,  all the attributes in the Publication table as per step 3 of section 3.7.2 shall  be accessible . 4. Public user reviews data and can either make a new query exit away  from the page. 5. Public user can make an export of the resulting list and all related attributes  in CSV format. The maximum number of records will be limited to a value  which shall be configurable by the ESMA IT Administrator . |

| Normal Flow     | 1.  The public user accesses anonymously the “File download page” in the  ESMA public web interface though a dedicated URL. 2.  Manually, the public user can search for a file by Publication date and by  File type (Full, Delta), select the file and save it onto its client System. 3.  Automatically, sends to the “File download page” a request, in a  predefined format, with Publication date and File type (Full, Delta) as  arguments. The ESMA public web interface processes the requests. In  case a single file matches the criteria, the request is accepted, and that  file is downloaded onto the client System. An error message is sent back  to the client system otherwise. In case more than one file match the  criteria, a list of URLs pointing to each of the instances is sent back to the  client system. |

## Otherwise:

4. The ESMA System extracts all the data records which Status is ' Active ' or 'Modified ' .
5. For each " extracted record " in the step 2, the ESMA System updates the MIC reference data table as described in section 15.3 Table 44 (including ValidityStartDate and ValidityEndDate technical attributes) as follows:
3. 5.1 The ESMA System checks whether it already exists in the table a record ("pre-existing record " ) with the same MICCODE and ValidityEndDate is NULL.
4. 5.2 If false (there is no existing valid record with same MIC, it is an addition), the ESMA System inserts the "extracted record" with the following attributes:
- MIC
- ISO COUNTRY CODE
- OPERATING MIC
- MIC TYPE
- NAME -INSTITUTION DESCRIPTION
- LEGAL NAME
- LEI
- ACRONYM
- CITY
- WEBSITE
- MODIF -ISO DATE
- CREATION -ISO DATE

- EXPIRY DATE
- STATUS
- COMMENT
- COUNTRY, as retrieved from "Countries data table", based on the ISO COUNTRY CODE
- MARKET TYPE as NULL (this field will be updated according to UC4.5 "Interface with ESMA Registers")
- ValidityStartDate is set to the "Modification implementation date "
- ValidityEndDate is set to NULL
- LastUpdatedDate is set to the current Date Time
26. 5.3 If true (there is an existing valid record with same MIC)
27. 5.3.1 The ESMA System checks whether the "pre-existing record" is identical to the "extracted record" on the following fields: MIC , ISO COUNTRY CODE, OPERATING MIC, MIC TYPE, NAME-

- ValidityEndDate is set to NULL
- LastUpdatedDate is set to the current Date Time
- 5.3.2.2 The ESMA System updates the "pre-existing" record with the following attributes:
- ValidityEndDate is set to the previous calendar day before the "Modification implementation date".
6. The ESMA System processes the 'Deleted' MIC according to the data provider:

Assumptions

- Validity End Date is Null.
- "Withdrawn flag" of the "Country of jurisdiction of the TV/SI" is FALSE in the "NCA reference data table.

2.

3. For each &lt;MIC&gt; retrieved in step 1, the system checks whether a record exists in "Reporting Calendar Days data table", which satisfies the following conditions:
- EntityIdentifier is T&lt;MIC&gt; or S&lt;MIC&gt; and
- date corresponding to the "current year+1"
4. 2.1. In case at least one record retrieved in Step 2, no further action is performed, and the system proceeds with the next MIC.

(in case that non-working days have been reported for the next year)

- 2.2. Otherwise, the ESMA System inserts a record into the "Reporting Calendar Days data table" for each calendar date of the "current year +1", as follows:
- EntityIdentifier as T&lt;MIC&gt; or S&lt;MIC&gt;, deduced from the MarketIdentifier as per section 14.1 Reporting Calendar Table, and
- date corresponding to each day of the "current year+1"
- Open attribute of (Entity Identifier, date) as TRUE

(in case that non-working days have not been reported for the next year)

3. For each of them, the following attributes are displayed: the NCA user country code (its own), the identifier of the index and the date of expression of interest.
4. The system allows the user to remove an index from that list. The system asks the user for confirmation as per step 10.
5. The user can add to that list one or several new indices. For that purpose, the user is proposed a list of indices in the database excluding those already part of the list) or is proposed to enter manually an ISIN . {In order to be compliant to TREM Specification 109., the ESMA System proposes indices that are identified by an ISIN (manually) and indices identified by the 4-letter code {INDEX} specified in table 1 of the Annex of RTS23 {INDEX}}
4. 5.1 The ESMA System proposes the list of RTS23 {INDEX} .
5. 5.2 The ESMA System proposes the list of ISIN already used as an "Underlying Index" as follows: select in the Consistent Reference Data Table distinct field 26c of records which PublicationFromDate is not NULL and PublicationToDate is NULL
6. 6.The ESMA System allows the user to select one of these.
7. Alternatively, The ESMA System allows the user to add another ISIN . In case the user enters an ISIN manually, the ESMA system checks that:
- the ISIN is valid according to the algorithm of ISIN validation including the calculation of the check digit 16 .
- the ISIN is not found in the "consistent reference data table" as a RTS23 field 1.
10. 8.In case the user inputs are valid, the system invites the user to confirm the selected list of indices codes / names / ISIN .
11. 9.Upon confirmation of the user, the system inserts the submitted data in the " Expression of interest on Indices reference data table " as follows:
- Country code of the Member State having expressed its interest: the country code of the user.
- ISINIndexIdentifier: the submitted one.
- OtherIndexIdentifier: the submitted one
- ValidityStartDate is the date the NCA user confirmed the submission.
- ValidityEndDate is NULL
10. In case the user confirms the removal , the system updates in the record which Index identifier is selected in the "Expression of interest on Indices reference data table" as follows:
- Country code of the Member State having expressed its interest: the country code of the user.
- ISINIndexIdentifier: the submitted one.
- OtherIndexIdentifier: the submitted one .
- ValidityEndDate is the date the NCA user confirmed the deletion of expression of interest.

| Normal Flow    | 1. The ESMA System selects, grouped by NCACountryCode in  ascending order, all records in the “Expression of interest on Indices  table” with the following attributes: •  NCACountryCode •  ISINIndexIdentifier or OtherIndexIdentifier •  ValidityStartDate •  ValidityEndDate 2. The ESMA System generates an “Expression of interest on indices” full file  based on the Derived Message Identifier schemas referenced in Table 11  -  Instrument reference data message table associated to Business  Application Header (BAH), BAH and business message encapsulation and  Expression of interest on indices file Message components . 3. The ESMA System archives that file in a zip file according to naming  convention (Annex 2: File naming conventions) and uploads in the Public  folder dedicated to the ESMA System in HUBEX System. |

| Assumptions    | ESMA collects and distributes Expression of interest on Indices but is not  involved in any way in their execution. NCAs will use this functionality only  to request transactions related to indices (not on other instruments). Distributed file must be kept 10 days at disposal of the NCAs. |

## Trigger

## Postconditions

## Normal Flow

System has an up-to-date table collecting all workings days for each TV/SI.

The use case is triggered daily after 0:00 CET .

Reminder status advice file is in the outgoing folder dedicated to the ESMA System for each concerned entity.

NB: T is the day of the next publication, PvsT is the day of last successful publication

1. The ESMA System extracts the list of TV/SI from which data is expected: the ESMA system selects MIC in the reporting calendar which satisfy all of the following conditions: Open is TRUE at least one date between PvsT and T -1.
2. For each MIC extracted in step 1 , The ESMA System checks whether any data has been submitted by the TV/SI: the ESMA selects in the " Received Reference Data Table " records with
- same MIC and for which at least one date exists in the "ESMA Reception Date Time List" between PvsT-1 applicable cut-off time AND T -1 applicable cut-off time
- where applicable cut-off time is the one related to the MIC in the " Reporting Flow view "
- Received Status is "REFR"
3. If no record is found , the ESMA System updates the "TV/SI reporting table" as per step 5 and generates a reminder file as per step 6 .
4. Otherwise , the ESMA system checks that Regulated Markets have reported all non-terminated instruments . In that case, the ESMA System generates a reminder file.
8. 4.1 The ESMA System selects in the " Received Reference Data Table" the (ISIN, MIC) records which satisfy all of the following conditions:
- MIC is the MIC in the step 1
- Termination date is NULL or , in case it is not NULL , is strictly later than PvsT -1
- Received Status is "REFR"
- No date exists in the "ESMA Reception Date Time List" between PvsT -1 applicable cut-off time AND T-1 applicable cutoff time, where applicable cut-off time is the one related to the MIC in the "Reporting Flow view "
- MICType is 'R ' for that MIC as per Table 18 - Trading venue mapping view
14. 4.2 In case at least one record is found, the ESMA System:
15. 4.2.1 updates the "TV/SI reporting table" as per step 5 .
16. 4.2.2 generates a reminder file as per step 6 .

Frequency

- 4.2.3 retains the list of ISINs of record found.
5. For each extracted MIC, the system inserts or updates in the " TV/SI reporting table " as described in section Table 41 -TV/SI Reporting table the following record:
- MIC
- Date is set to T -1
- "Unreported ISIN List" is left empty if triggered by step 3, and is set to the list of ISINs present in the records extracted in step 4.2 if triggered by step 4
- "Inconsistent ISIN list and associated fields" is left empty .
6. The ESMA System:
- 6.1 generates a reminder file based on the Derived Message Identifier schemas referenced in Table 11 -Instrument reference data message table associated to Business Application Header (BAH), BAH and business message encapsulation and Reminder file Message components.
- ➔ With the following attributes in the BAH:
- From is EU
- To is HUB sender code associated to the MIC as per Table 19 -Reporting Flow view .
- ➔ with the following attributes in the StatusReport header:
- FileStatus is Reminder;
- If triggered by step 3, "RMD-001" validation rule as per section 11 Reminder Message code and description .
- ➔ If triggered by step 4, for each ISIN retained in step 4.2, a record status block with the following attributes:
- a. ISIN
- b. " RMD -002 " validation rule as per section 11 Reminder Message code and description . .
- 6.2 names it according to the following components as per Annex 2: File naming conventions:
- Sender is FIRDS
- FileType is RMDINS
- Recipient is the HUBSenderCode related to the MIC in the Reporting Flow view (Table 19 - Reporting Flow view) .
- Key1 is MIC
- Key2 (From 00000 incremented by 1 each time a reminder file is generated)
- Year is the Year of the current ESMA System datetime .
- 6.3 archives it into a zip file using the same filename.
- 6.4 uploads the zip file in the " Outgoing folder" r" of the ESMA System in HUBEX/HUBDE.

For each extracted MIC record, the system checks whether at least one  of the following conditions is TRUE: •  A record exists in “MICs data table”, for the MIC, with Validity  End Date as NULL. •  A record exists in “Trading Venue Mapping View ”  for the MIC  with Validity End Date as NULL 3.  For the records that passed the step 2 validation, the ESMA system  checks whether a record already exists  for the MIC  in  “ MIC_UPREG_STAGING data table”. 3.1 In case no record is found, the system performs the necessary  Market Type transformation and inserts a new record in  “MIC_UPREG_STAGING data table”, as follows: •  Creation Date as the Current Date Time •  MIC •  Market_Type (the mapping is RMKT for MIR, OTFS for MIO,  MLTF for MIT, SINT for MIS) •  Authority Name •  NCA Country Code •  Status as “Pending” •  Latest Flag as TRUE •  Status Update Date as NULL •  Last Retrieval Date as the Current Date Time •  User ID as NULL 3.2 Otherwise (a record exists for the MIC): 3.2.1  The ESMA System checks whether the pre-existing record is identical to the extracted one on the following fields:  •  MIC •  Market_Type •  Authority Name •  NCA Country Code And If true, the system updates the Last Retrieval Date to the |

Assumptions

- 3.2.2 Otherwise (the record is modified):
- i. The system updates the pre-existing record by setting the Latest Flag as FALSE.
- ii. The system inserts a new record for the MIC in "MIC\_UPREG\_STAGING data table", as per step 3.1.
4. The system dispatches an email notification to notify the ESMA Business Administrator for new pending MIC information updates.
5. The system logs the successful process execution to retain a history of passed executions.
6. The information stored in the "MIC\_UPREG\_STAGING data table" will be available onto a dedicated page on ESMA portal, as per chapter 3.12.4.6 .

In case of any issue, the system notifies the ESMA IT administrator and logs the erroneous execution.

Daily

The ESMA Business Administrator will be able to access the relevant information from a dedicated page on ESMA portal, and to approve or not any updates indicated by the interface with Authorised Entities. In case of approval, the respective updates will be implemented in the "MICs " and/or "Trading Venue Mapping" data tables .

## 7 Annex 1a: Transmission Validation Rules

When a submitting entity uploads a file into HUBEX/HUBDE , preliminary transmission checks are performed based on the file naming convention [Annex 2: File naming conventions] as follows:

- Check that &lt;Sender&gt; matches the sender account (It is not possible for an entity to submit a file on behalf of another) ,
- If OK, check that the file naming convention is respected,
- If OK, check that the sender is allowed to send files to the receiver, and
- If OK, check that file size is lower than remaining disk quota size.

## 12 Annex 2: File naming conventions

The XML files sent by the Submitting Entity (NCA or TV/SI) to ESMA must comply with the following naming convention:

## &lt;Sender&gt;\_&lt;FileType&gt;\_&lt;Recipient&gt;\_&lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt;\_&lt;Year&gt;.xml

The Submitting Entity archives the XML file into a ZIP fileand uploadsonto the HUBEX/HUBDE System . Its name must comply with the same naming convention:

## &lt;Sender&gt;\_&lt;FileType&gt;\_&lt;Recipient&gt;\_&lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt;\_&lt;Year&gt;.zip

As soon as HUBEX/HUBDE routes the file, it suffixes it with a timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format (24h format, UTC Time). Therefore, as soon as the file is placed in the submitting entity's Outgoing folder dedicated to the ESMA System, the naming convention for the files becomes:

## &lt;Sender&gt;\_&lt;FileType&gt;\_&lt;Recipient&gt;\_&lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt;\_&lt;Year&gt;\_Timestamp.zip

The ESMA System uploads the file from the incoming folder dedicated to it, unzips the ZIP file and checks that XML filename and ZIP filename are consistent [All component of the filenames are equal excluding timestamp].

The following table provides description of the components of the filename:

| Component   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Key1        | A 5-letter character code which is reused by the system when generating a feedback  file related to this file. Key1 can be used as needed by the Submitting Entity. For example, a NCA may want  to populate it with T<MIC code of a TV> or S<MIC code of a SI> referring to the TV/SI  which originally submitted the file to the NCA; this way, the name of the ESMA feedback  file will contain the identification of the TV/SI under its jurisdiction which is concerned  by the feedback file . If not needed by the submitting entity, any 5-letter character code can be used. |
| Key2        | A unique 6-digit number completed with zeros to fit to 6 characters (e.g. 000157). It  does not depend on the file type, recipient or any other characteristic. It can start again  at 000000 after 999999. This number is to be incremented each time a sender sends a  new file .  This number identifies uniquely a file. Should a problem occur in the sending  of the file, the SequenceNumber will help identifying the file.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Year        | A 2 - digit attribute. It is the year when the file has been generated.

A file generated by the ESMA System (feedback file, consolidated files, or reminder files), and which has to be routed to the appropriate recipient via HUBEX/HUBDE System as per Table 38 File types , must comply with the following attributes:

## &lt;Sender&gt;\_&lt;FileType&gt;\_&lt;Recipient&gt;\_&lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt;\_&lt;Year&gt;.xml

The ESMA System archives the XML file into a ZIP file and uploads onto the HUBEX/HUBDE System in the outgoing folder dedicated to the ESMA System. Its name must comply with the following naming convention:

## &lt;Sender&gt;\_&lt;FileType&gt;\_&lt;Recipient&gt;\_&lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt;\_&lt;Year&gt;.zip

As soon as HUBEX/HUBDE routes the file to the recipient, it suffixes it with a timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format (24h format, UTC Time). Therefore, as soon as the file is placed in the appropriate folder dedicated to the ESMA System (as per HUBEX/HUDE folder in Table 38 - File types) , the naming convention for the file becomes:

## &lt;Sender&gt;\_&lt;FileType&gt;\_&lt;Recipient&gt;\_&lt;Key1&gt;-&lt;Key2&gt;\_&lt;Year&gt;\_Timestamp.zip

The following table provides description of the components of the file name:

| Component   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                              |

## 13 Annex 3 Business Application header

The Business Application Header (BAH) is a header that has been defined by the ISO 20022 community that can form part of an ISO 20022 business message. Specifically, the BAH is an ISO 20022 message definition (head.001.001.01) which can be combined with any other ISO 20022 message definition to form a business message.

It gathers together, in one place, data about the message, such as which organisation has sent the business message, which organisation should be receiving it, the identity of the message itself, a reference for the message and so on.

The purpose of the BAH is to provide a consistent and predictable way for this data to be conveyed with the message, regardless of implementation factors such as the choice of network.

The use of the BAH in MiFIR messages is mandatory.

The below table presents the list of mandatory elements of the BAH that should be included in all messages and how they should be populated:

TABLE 39 -FIELDS OF BUSINESS APPLICATION HEADER

The data files received from submitting entities (incoming file as per Table 38 - File types) or generated by the system except LEI full file (reminder and consolidated file as per Table 38 - File types) encapsulate the Business Application Header (BAH), Message Header (MHD) and Business Fields (BF):

- Business Application Header shall be encapsulated under "BizData/Hdr"
- Message Header shall be encapsulated under "BizData/Pyld"
- Business Fields shall be encapsulated under "BizData/Pyld"

In addition, the following namespaces need to be defined when creating the XML message:

&lt;BizData xmlns="urn:iso:std:iso:20022:tech:xsd:head.003.001.01 "

xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance "

xsi:schemaLocation="urn:iso:std:iso:20022:tech:xsd:head.003.001.01 head.003.001.01.xsd "

Base Message Identifier} {ISO 20022 Derived Message Identifier}}"&gt; as per Table 11 -Instrument reference data message table and Table 12 - Additional reference data message table .

The example below is given for a DATINS incoming message:
